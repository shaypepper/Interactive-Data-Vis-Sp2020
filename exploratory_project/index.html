      <h1>Bill Cunningham in the evening hours</h1>
      <p>Over fifteen years, Bill Cunningham published a column weekly with photographs of charities, fundraisers, and various events in the arts. He had a heart for philanthropy. What is incredible is just how many events he would make it to in a given week. Note: this was in addition to his column called On the Street. For that, he captured photos of every day folks around town. He often worked 10-12 hour days up until he passed away in 2016. His last column was just two weeks before he passed. This is a tribute to his work.</p>
